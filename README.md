# SVD Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a dimensionality reduction technique. The application provides movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering and allows users to explore movie data interactively.

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: Get personalized movie recommendations based on your ratings
- **Similar Movies**: Find movies similar to ones you already like
- **Movie Explorer**: Search and browse through the movie database
- **User Analysis**: View user profiles and rating patterns
- **Educational Content**: Learn about SVD and how it works for recommendation systems

## Dataset

The application uses the MovieLens 1M dataset, which contains:
- 1 million ratings from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies
- Each user has rated at least 20 movies
- Demographic information for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip code)
- Movie information (title, genres)
